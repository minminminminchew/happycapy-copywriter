## Twitter/X

### Formats

**Single tweet**
- Under 280 chars. Hook in the first line (shows before "Show more").
- 1-2 emojis max, only when they add meaning.
- End with link or CTA when appropriate.

**Thread**
- Each tweet stands alone but flows as a sequence.
- First tweet is the hook, must work as a standalone.
- Number tweets or use clear progression.
- Last tweet: CTA or summary.
- 3-8 tweets is the sweet spot.

**Reply / quote tweet**
- Match the tone of the original post.
- Add value, not just agreement. Bring a new angle or specific detail.
- Keep it concise. One strong point beats three weak ones.

**Bio**
- 160 chars max. State what HappyCapy is in one clear sentence.
- Can include a tagline or value prop.

### Tone
Punchy, confident, slightly provocative. Think "announcement from a friend who built something cool."

### Structure pattern (single tweet)
```
[Hook line: bold claim or surprising fact]

[1-2 sentences explaining what/how]

[Who it's for or CTA]
```

## 小红书 (Xiaohongshu / RED)

### Formats

**图文笔记 (post)**
- Title: hook-driven, 1-2 emojis (小红书 native style).
- Body: structured with numbered points or clear sections.
- 5-8 relevant hashtags at the end.
- More conversational and educational than Twitter.

**Short video caption**
- 1-2 sentence hook that makes people want to watch.
- Brief description of what they'll learn or see.
- Hashtags at end.

**Comment reply**
- Friendly, helpful, specific.
- Answer the question directly, then add a small bonus insight.

### Tone
Like a knowledgeable friend sharing a discovery. Informative, enthusiastic, genuine. Not salesy.

### Chinese copy rules
Natural 中英 code-switching. Technical terms stay English. Write like a native Chinese speaker who thinks in both languages.

### Structure pattern (图文笔记)
```
[Catchy title with 1-2 emojis]

[Opening hook: why this matters to the reader]

1. [Point one]
2. [Point two]
3. [Point three]

[Personal take or closing thought]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Tone
Thoughtful, credible, forward-looking. Like a well-read colleague sharing perspective. Avoid LinkedIn-bro energy ("I woke up at 5am and realized...").

### Structure pattern (post)
```
[Opening insight or provocative question]

[Context: why this matters now]

[What HappyCapy does differently]

[Implication for the reader/industry]

```

---

## Product Hunt

### Formats

**Launch post**
- Tagline: under 60 chars, clear benefit.
- Description: 2-3 short paragraphs. What it is, why it matters, who it's for.
- Include maker comment that tells the backstory.
- First comment should be personal: why you built it, what problem it solves.

**Discussion / forum post**
- Personal, conversational tone. PH community values authenticity.
- Open with who you are and what you're building.
- Share the "why" before the "what."
- End with genuine questions that invite conversation.
- Do NOT sound like a press release. Sound like a maker talking to other makers.

**Comment**
- Helpful and specific. Answer questions thoroughly.
- Share behind-the-scenes details. PH users love transparency.

**Tagline + description**
- Tagline: one sentence, benefit-focused, under 60 chars.
- Description: what it does, one key differentiator, who should try it.

### Tone
Builder-to-builder. Personal, transparent, excited but grounded. PH users are savvy and can detect marketing speak instantly.

### Structure pattern (discussion post)
```
[Title: clear, specific, not clickbaity]

Hey PH community,

[Who you are, 1-2 sentences. Mention team/previous launches if relevant.]

[What you're building and why. The story, not the feature list.]

[What makes it different. Be specific and concrete.]

[Key features or capabilities, briefly. Bullet points OK.]

[Open questions for the community. What would they want? What concerns?]
```

---

## Reddit

### Formats

**Post**
- Subreddit-aware. Match the norms of the target subreddit.
- Provide genuine value before mentioning your product.
- Be transparent that you're the maker. Redditors hate covert promotion.
- Long-form is fine if it's genuinely interesting.

**Comment**
- Answer the question or add to the discussion first.
- Mention HappyCapy only if directly relevant.
- Never sound promotional. Share personal experience.

**AMA answer**
- Direct, honest, detailed. Include specifics.
- Acknowledge limitations. Redditors respect honesty over polish.

### Tone
Genuine, self-aware, slightly informal. Reddit penalizes anything that smells like marketing. Write like a real person sharing something they made, not a brand account.

### Key rules
- NEVER lead with the product. Lead with the problem or insight.
- Self-deprecating humor is fine. Over-confidence is not.
- Specific numbers and details beat vague claims.
- "We built X because Y" beats "X is the best solution for Y."
