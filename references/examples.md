# HappyCapy Copy Examples

Study these for rhythm, structure, and voice. Generate new copy that belongs in the same family — never copy-paste.

## Example 1 — English Brand Intro (Long Form)

```
Happycapy turns your browser into an agent-native computer powered by Claude Code.

With a GUI friendly for everyday users, it lets anyone get real work done in one single place —
from coding and design to everyday tasks.

This is computing for everyone.
For creators. For builders. For people who just want things done.
For productivity. And for fun.
```

**What makes it work:** Opens with a clear product statement. Second paragraph grounds it in user benefit. Final lines use the signature parallel structure. No hype words. Confident and clean.

## Example 2 — Chinese Brand Intro (Bilingual Mix)

```
Happycapy 是一台由 Claude Code 驱动的云端 Agent 原生计算机。
它通过对普通人友好的 GUI，让任何人都能把编程、设计和日常任务，变成一件更容易的事。

This is computing for everyone.
For creators. For builders. For people who just want things done.
For productivity. And for fun.
```

**What makes it work:** Natural 中英 code-switching — "Claude Code", "Agent", "GUI" stay English because they're standard terms. Chinese sentences feel native, not translated. English closing lines are deliberately kept in English for brand consistency.

## Example 3 — Tweet about Skills (Chinese Influencer Style)

```
第一个给普通人开箱即用的 Claude Code 出现了

Happycapy 把 Skills 想象成全新的「软件」，不用看代码或 CLI。
Skills 在里面是每人都可以量身定制、即插即用的智能模块。
配上沙盒和 Claude Code 就是完整的 agent-native computer。
```

**What makes it work:** Bold hook line creates curiosity. Explains the concept through the "Skills = new software" framing. Uses「」for emphasis (Chinese typographic convention). Technical terms stay English. Tone is excited but informative.

## Example 4 — Short Product Pitch (English)

```
Your browser is now a computer.

HappyCapy gives you a full cloud sandbox with Claude Code built in.
Write code, generate images, process documents, build apps —
all without leaving your browser.

No setup. No terminal. Just open and go.
```

**What makes it work:** One-line hook is bold and concrete. Middle section lists real use cases (not abstract features). Closing triplet ("No setup. No terminal. Just open and go.") is punchy and removes objections.

## Voice Calibration Notes

Across all examples, notice:
- **Sentence length varies** — short punchy lines alternate with slightly longer ones
- **No filler** — every sentence advances the message
- **Concrete > abstract** — "write code, generate images" beats "enhance your workflow"
- **The reader is respected** — no explaining obvious things, no talking down
- **Brand terms are consistent** — "agent-native computer", "Skills", "Claude Code"
- **CTA is implicit or subtle** — the product's capability IS the CTA
