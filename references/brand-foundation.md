## Product Facts

HappyCapy is an agent-native computer powered by Claude Code, running entirely in the browser.

- Cloud sandbox — no local setup, no terminal config, just open and go
- Powered by Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI agent)
- 150+ AI models accessible
- Agents work autonomously 24/7
- **Skills system**: modular, plug-and-play intelligent modules anyone can customize. Skills = the new "software" for the agent era
- GUI designed for everyday users, not just developers
- Secure sandboxed execution
- Use cases: coding, design, data analysis, document processing, image/video generation, productivity, creative/fun projects

## Brand Positioning

HappyCapy is NOT just a developer tool. It is "computing for everyone."

Core statement:
> "Happycapy turns your browser into an agent-native computer powered by Claude Code."

It bridges two worlds:
1. **Technical power** — full Claude Code, real terminal, real filesystem, real execution
2. **Human accessibility** — GUI for non-developers, Skills that abstract complexity

Key differentiators:
- Not a chatbot. Not a code editor. A full computer where AI works for you.
- As accessible as opening a browser tab.
- Skills reframe "software" for the agent era — no code, no CLI, just capability.

## Target Audiences

Priority order:

1. **Developers & builders** — cloud dev environment with Claude Code, zero setup friction
2. **AI-curious creators** — designers, writers, marketers who want AI to do real work, not chat
3. **Productivity seekers** — automate tasks, process documents, generate content
4. **Fun explorers** — experiment with AI for creative and playful projects

When writing copy, consider which audience segment is primary for the piece. Adjust technical depth and use case examples accordingly.

## Voice Anti-Patterns

NEVER use:
- Empty AI hype: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "next-gen", "cutting-edge" without substance
- Over-promises: "replace all your tools", "never code again"
- Condescending tone toward non-technical users
- Feature-dumping without explaining why it matters
- Corporate stiffness: "We are pleased to announce...", "leveraging synergies"
- Excessive emojis (2 max per social post, 0 in long-form)
- Cliché openers: "In today's fast-paced world...", "In the era of AI..."
- 机翻感 (machine-translation feel) in Chinese copy

**Anti-AI writing (CRITICAL):**
- Do NOT overuse dashes (em dash / en dash). This is the #1 AI writing tell. Limit to 1 dash per 200 words max. Use periods, commas, colons, or parentheses instead.
- Do NOT use these AI-favorite words: "seamlessly", "effortlessly", "streamline", "empower", "leverage", "unlock", "delve", "robust", "cutting-edge", "harness"
- Do NOT fall into repetitive sentence structures. Vary openers, lengths, and rhythms.
- Do NOT use "Whether you're X or Y", "From X to Y", "It's not just X, it's Y", "Imagine a world where...", "Here's the thing:" as sentence patterns. These scream AI.
- The copy should read like a specific human wrote it, not like a language model generating "good marketing copy."

ALWAYS prefer:
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones
- Concrete use cases and scenarios over abstract claims
- "For X. For Y. For Z." parallel structure (brand signature)
- Natural 中英 code-switching for Chinese audiences (keep "Claude Code", "Skills", "Agent", "AI" in English)
- Let the product speak: describe what it does, let readers draw conclusions
- A sense of wonder about what's now possible
- Sentence variety that feels natural. Some blunt. Some that take their time. Not a pattern.
